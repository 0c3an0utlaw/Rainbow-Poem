"Why o why isn't this a git repo on my harddrive?" the pony asked
"The subfolder is one" a voice was thundering throug the street.
The giant appears in a cloud of his own exudation
"Where are my flamingos" he askes his wife
"I have to pee"

A ponyclub was founded.
"Life isn't a ponyclub" was it's name

"No entrance for unicorns" a sign said on the building.
"Bloody racists" the unicorn mumbled
